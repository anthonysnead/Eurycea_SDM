This repository contains the data and code to reproduce _Conserved Ecological Responses to Novel Urban Stressors_. 

The **R markdown file** contains all the code and is annotated. We annotated the R markdown file by line to describe each command and by chunk to provide context for the analysis. All files are stored in the **main** branch.
